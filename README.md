[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/A2A.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/A2A/)

A .NET library that helps run agentic applications as A2AServers following the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org).

The A2A .NET SDK provides a robust implementation of the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and applications. This library offers both high-level abstractions and fine-grained control, making it easy to build A2A-compatible agents while maintaining flexibility for advanced use cases.

Key features include:
- **Agent Capability Discovery**: Retrieve agent capabilities and metadata through agent cards
- **Message-based Communication**: Direct, stateless messaging with immediate responses
- **Task-based Communication**: Create and manage persistent, long-running agent tasks
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time communication using Server-Sent Events
- **ASP.NET Core Integration**: Built-in extensions for hosting A2A agents in web applications
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Supports .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 8+

## Protocol Compatibility

This library implements most of the features of protocol v0.2.6, however there are some scenarios that are not yet complete for full compatibility with this version. A complete list of outstanding compatibility items can be found at: [open compatibility items](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-dotnet/issues?q=is:issue%20is:open%20(label:v0.2.4%20OR%20label:v0.2.5%20OR%20label:v0.2.6))

## Installation

### Core A2A Library

```bash
dotnet add package A2A
```

### ASP.NET Core Extensions

```bash
dotnet add package A2A.AspNetCore
```

## Overview
![alt text](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-dotnet/raw/main/overview.png)

## Library: A2A
This library contains the core A2A protocol implementation. It includes the following key classes:

### Client Classes
- **`A2AClient`**: Primary client for making A2A requests to agents. Supports both streaming and non-streaming communication, task management, and push notifications.
- **`A2ACardResolver`**: Resolves agent card information from A2A-compatible endpoints to discover agent capabilities and metadata.

### Server Classes  
- **`TaskManager`**: Manages the complete lifecycle of agent tasks including creation, updates, cancellation, and event streaming. Handles both message-based and task-based communication patterns.
- **`ITaskStore`**: An interface for abstracting the storage of tasks.
- **`InMemoryTaskStore`**: Simple in-memory implementation of `ITaskStore` suitable for development and testing scenarios.

### Core Models
- **`AgentTask`**: Represents a task with its status, history, artifacts, and metadata.
- **`AgentCard`**: Contains agent metadata, capabilities, and endpoint information.
- **`Message`**: Represents messages exchanged between agents and clients.

## Library: A2A.AspNetCore
This library provides ASP.NET Core integration for hosting A2A agents. It includes the following key classes:

### Extension Methods
- **`A2ARouteBuilderExtensions`**: Provides `MapA2A()` and `MapHttpA2A()` extension methods for configuring A2A endpoints in ASP.NET Core applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Agent Server

```csharp
using A2A;
using A2A.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Create and register your agent
var taskManager = new TaskManager();
var agent = new EchoAgent();
agent.Attach(taskManager);

app.MapA2A(taskManager, "/echo");
app.Run();

public class EchoAgent
{
    public void Attach(ITaskManager taskManager)
    {
        taskManager.OnMessageReceived = ProcessMessageAsync;
        taskManager.OnAgentCardQuery = GetAgentCardAsync;
    }

    private Task<Message> ProcessMessageAsync(MessageSendParams messageSendParams, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var text = messageSendParams.Message.Parts.OfType<TextPart>().First().Text;
        return Task.FromResult(new Message
        {
            Role = MessageRole.Agent,
            MessageId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            ContextId = messageSendParams.Message.ContextId,
            Parts = [new TextPart { Text = $"Echo: {text}" }]
        });
    }

    private Task<AgentCard> GetAgentCardAsync(string agentUrl, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new AgentCard
        {
            Name = "Echo Agent",
            Description = "Echoes messages back to the user",
            Url = agentUrl,
            Version = "1.0.0",
            DefaultInputModes = ["text"],
            DefaultOutputModes = ["text"],
            Capabilities = new AgentCapabilities { Streaming = true }
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Connect with A2AClient

```csharp
using A2A;

// Discover agent and create client
var cardResolver = new A2ACardResolver(new Uri("http://localhost:5100/"));
var agentCard = await cardResolver.GetAgentCardAsync();
var client = new A2AClient(new Uri(agentCard.Url));

// Send message
var response = await client.SendMessageAsync(new MessageSendParams
{
    Message = new Message
    {
        Role = MessageRole.User,
        Parts = [new TextPart { Text = "Hello!" }]
    }
});
```
